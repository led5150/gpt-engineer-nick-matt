Make a game where the player must navigate their ship through an astroid field without hitting
and asteroid. The players ship should look like the enterprise from Star Trek the Next Generation.
The game should be in 2d and be a top to bottom scoller, so that the players ship is always at the
bottom of the screen and asteroids come from the top of the screen and move towards the bottom.
The game should have the following features:
* A high score list where players high scores are displayed at the end of the game. We want to show
only the top ten player scores.
* We want to track every players score and keep the top score for every player so we can show them
  the best performace they've had so far. This should be displayed at the end of every game.
* The player has 3 lives, when a player hits and asteroid, the game pauses, then resumes until they 
  are out of lives, at which point the game ends and their final score is displayed, and then displays
  the top ten player scores.
* players score is determined by the length of time they survive.
* A login at the start where a player can put their username and a password so we can track their
  top score.
  * The number of astroids increases slowly as time goes on. As in, at the beginning of the game,
  there are few asteroids, but as time goes on there are more and more making the game harder over time.
