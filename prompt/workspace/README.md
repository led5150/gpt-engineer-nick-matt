The game will be implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The core classes and functions that will be necessary are:

1. `Game`: This class will handle the game loop, events, and rendering.
2. `Player`: This class will represent the player's spaceship. It will handle movement and collision detection.
3. `Asteroid`: This class will represent the asteroids. It will handle movement and collision detection.
4. `Score`: This class will keep track of the player's score.

The entrypoint file will be `main.py`, which will initialize the game and start the game loop.

Now let's proceed with the implementation of each file.
