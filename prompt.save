Make a game where the player must navigate a space ship through an asteroid field without hitting 
an asteroid. The ship should be a circle with two columns on either side.
The game should be in 2d and be a top to bottom scoller, so that the players ship is always at the
bottom of the screen and asteroids come from the top of the screen and move towards the bottom.
While the game runs the players score is displayed in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
The asteroids should be random polygons with a size that is as big as the player ship.
The score is calculated by the number of seconds the plaer has been alive * 10.
The game ends when a player hits an asteroid.
When the game ends the players score is diplayed along with a large GAME OVER text.
The player controls the ship by use of the left and right arrow keys.
